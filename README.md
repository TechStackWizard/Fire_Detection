# Fire_Detection
I am going to take my first step in ML through creating this project with my AICTE internship. 
This project is about the predicting which type of fire or deforestation is going in the world by using the MODIS satellite Dataset.

I am adding the link in the readme file since my Model - best_fire_detection_model.pkl file is 460.1 MB. Any file larger than 25 MB is not accepted in the Github without LFS.
